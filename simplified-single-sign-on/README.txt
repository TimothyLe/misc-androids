Android Lab 1

Requirements:
Login UI, cancel button, sign on button, Toast errors

Layout, UI look and feel:
The UI is sleek with all the input and text boxes needed. Only issue is when you click on input text, you have to fill it out and move on to the next then when you're done you can hide keyboard. Tried to resolve but had more issues so it will be this way.

Coding structure and documentation/comments:
Comments are left almost everywhere to explain every line of code and reason for using the library functions and so forth. The code is modeled off of online examples for help with function writing and proving results through generate a simulation. Code was written from lab computers so time and processing was limited to operate on this code. The code can be run by building it and clicking the play button. The app should load on screen and you should receive the UI instantly.
